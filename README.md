Simple Gridscale Virtual Data-Center (vDC) Command-Line Interface (CLI)

Abstract
--------

This is a very simple, incomplete and rookie Command-Line Interface
(CLI) for the Gridscale Virtual Data-Center (vDC), as used by the
msg systems ag. It currently provides only VM power on/off and SSH
remote command execution in order to conveniently start and stop VMs.
It is currently intended to be used inside the special Gridscale vDC
environment of the msg Cloud only and potentially will NOT work with the
general Gridscale vDC.
